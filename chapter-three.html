                  The great realization, I also call it my great satori awakening, happened six months prior to my completion. It was May
                  15th of 2017 when my 19-year-old dance instructor Dhalia Lazcares dropped me off at the Oaxaca airport in Mexico. I had
                  taken vacation time from Microsoft to spend two full weeks with her. She was helping me clean up my dance routine
                  outside her school hours. One side note on Dhalia, do not let her young age distract you. This girl became a
                  professional world champion dancer at age 12!
                </p>
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  After checking in for my flight I noticed that I had an eight-hour flight to get to Seattle. I figured it would be a
                  good idea to download a book for the long flight. Via a series of coincidences, I ended up downloading a book that
                  sounded interesting. It was called “Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself” by Dr Joe Dispenza. I downloaded it, got in
                  the plane, and started to read it just as one starts to read any ordinary book. Yet I was about to find out that this
                  was no ordinary book for me.

                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  Just as I opened it, still in chapter 1, it all happened. In a single instant, the words in that book illuminated a
                  different vantage point for my entire life, including my own connection to the Universe. For the sake of simplicity, I
                  will not go into the details of my realization here because I would have to dive into several Physics topics and we
                  don’t have the space on this chapter to dive into that. But I will say the following, “Breaking the habit of being
                  yourself” came into my life at the right time and in the right setting to help me realize the incredible power of the
                  mind and body connection.
                </p>
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  Dr Joe Dispenza explains that we need to be coherent or in alignment, between how we think and how we feel in order to
                  achieve our goals. When we are in alignment between our minds and our hearts, we generate a coherent or orderly signal
                  that is then sent to our surrounding environment. On the contrary, when we are not in alignment between how we think and
                  how we feel, we send out an incoherent or disorderly signal to our surrounding environment. This happens whether we are
                  conscious of it or not.
                </p>
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  In that moment I realized how disciplined I had been with my dance training. For three years, I had been meticulous,
                  diligent, and perseverant to learn a brand new skill; I was even in the middle of Mexico training with a 19-year-old
                  high schooler for heaven sake. Yet, even though I trained like a dancer, and I looked like a dancer, I did not feel like
                  a dancer. In my heart I was full of doubt. I had no idea who I would compete with, but it was likely that whomever would
                  show up to a world stage, she surely must have been a dancer for a lot longer than me. Who knows, maybe she had been
                  dancing since she was a child. These thoughts and feelings were lingering in my subconscious mind.

                  The relevant note to make here is that even though I was fully onboard with my mind, my feelings were telling a
                  different story. I was producing incoherent signals between my mind and my feelings, and If I showed up to compete with
                  that state of being, my own energy could unintentionally sabotage my competition. Regardless of how much I trained my
                  technique.
                </p>
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  I evaluated Dr Joe’s claims against my past successes. I had practically succeeded in everything I ever set my mind
                  into. If he was right about mind and body coherence, then why didn’t I fail more often when I was not aware of what I
                  was emitting energetically? The answer popped into my head loud and clear. I succeeded because every fiber of my being
                  desired nothing more than to show my daughter Jeilymar that anything was possible. In other words, I was always
                  signaling a coherent message even when I was not conscious about it. The dance experiment was different because Jeilymar
                  was not the main motivator for my new endeavor. After she started college, I was just experiencing life and testing new
                  grounds with a completely different motivation.

              <div class="last-ch-content-box wow fadeInUp">
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  The premise of Dr Joes’s claims made complete sense to me, and so, I had to address the incoherent signals I was
                  sending
                  out to the Universe. The good news is that the completion was still six months away, and I was well equipped with the
                  discipline and tools I needed to conduct a second experiment. This is when I started meditating and introspecting to
                  align myself between how I acted externally, and how I felt inside.
                </p>
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  Fast forward to December 2017. I still remember the moment when I walked up to the stage for my final run. I took a
                  moment to sit with my emotions and I recall thinking the following: “I do not need a title to tell me that I am a
                  dancer, because regardless of what the judges say, I already feel that I won. Yet, if I do win, I have to share what I
                  have discovered with as many people as I can”. I then surrendered the outcome to the Universe and proceeded to perform
                  my two-minute routine.
                </p>
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  What happened during those two minutes was a bit surreal. Even with the high stakes of performing in front of world
                  class judges, there was no stress, no pressure, I was simply free.
                </p>
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  This state of peak performance and flow was such a different experience for me, that it actually felt wrong. After I
                  walked off the stage, I told my dance instructor Jhon that I had entered sort of dream state and I know I did not
                  perform as I usually did; under stress and pressure to do well. To my surprise Jhon responded with the following words
                  “Keep walking Fernmarie, that was your best run ever”.
                </p>
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  The next day the judges presented us with a first-place trophy at the World Latin Dance Cup.
                </p>
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  And so i started my Journey to the Unknown
                  A few months later I quit my job, quit my dance team, sold my home and ventured off to understand more about meditation,
                  introspection. I have spent the last two and a half years re-thinking, re-calibrating, re-evaluating my purpose, my
                  career, and my approach to life. I can write an entire book just to describe the magic that I have witnessed since then,
                  but that will certainly be a story for another time.
                </p>
                <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                  For now, I will leave you with this; The moment we start to master our internal state, that is the moment that we start
                  living life to its fullest.
